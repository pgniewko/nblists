DESCRIPTION
==================================================
The ```nblists``` library - a library to identify potential neigbor particles using Linked-Cell Lists in a time O(N).


GETTING THE CODE
==================================================
* To get the code:
```
git clone git@github.com:pgniewko/nblists.git
```

* To obtain the most recent version of the code:
```
git pull origin master
```

COMPILING AND INSTALLATION - UNIX
==================================================

* To build a library by typing:
```
make
```

* To install in /usr/local directory (requires a root access):
```
make install
```

USAGE - EXE file
==================================================

* To compile main.cpp file run in a command line (once you've installed the library):
```
make exe
```

The command will result with a binary file run_nbody. Execute this file to run an exemplary simulation.

* To run the exe file type in a command line (refer the code snippet below for the meaning of the arguments):
```
./run_nblists  
```

* An example of how to use the ```nblists``` library: 
```C++
...
